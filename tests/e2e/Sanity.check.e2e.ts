// Checkly is a tool used to monitor deployed environments, such as production or preview environments.
// It runs end-to-end tests with the `.check.e2e.ts` extension after each deployment to ensure that the environment is up and running.
// With Checkly, you can monitor your production environment and run `*.check.e2e.ts` tests regularly at a frequency of your choice.
// If the tests fail, Checkly will notify you via email, Slack, or other channels of your choice.
// On the other hand, E2E tests ending with `*.e2e.ts` are only run before deployment.
// You can run them locally or on CI to ensure that the application is ready for deployment.
